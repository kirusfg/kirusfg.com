My name is **Kirill Kirillov**; I am a software engineer currently studying at
Nazarbayev University.

It is often said that a good professional is T-shaped: they know a little
about everything and a lot about one thing. My genuine interest in every art
and field has allowed me to obtain a good perspective of things, but slowed
down my professional growth to some extent; I am working on that now.

My experience spans **full-stack WEB development**, **systems programming**
(game-engines), tooling, as well as machine learning. I work with
**JavaScript/TypeScript**, **Rust**, **Python**, and **C/C++**. Linux
and Git is second nature. Notable projects I have worked on are listed
[here](/projects).

As of writing this, **I am looking for a position as a software
developer**. You can find me almost anywhere as **kirusfg**:
