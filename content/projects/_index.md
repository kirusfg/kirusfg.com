I have been tinkering with a substantial number of languages
and frameworks - GUIs using Qt, shells in C and C++, web servers
([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/),
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Spring
Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/), [Actix](https://actix.rs/))
and apps (mostly [React](https://reactjs.org/)) - but the scope of those
projects is small making them not really worth attention.

Below are projects that I loved working on or/and still am
working on. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/kirusfg) and
[SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~kirusfg) pages to see what I've been up
to lately.
